## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- An [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) instance (self-hosted or cloud-based)

### Steps to Install
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mugambijavan/AgroSense.git
   cd AgroSense
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:
   ```env
   # Microsoft Fabric & Azure AI
   FABRIC_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-fabric-endpoint
   AZURE_AI_KEY=your-azure-ai-key
   AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=your-azure-ai-endpoint

   # Appwrite Configuration
   APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-endpoint
   APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-appwrite-project-id
   APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-appwrite-api-key
   ```
   Replace placeholder values (e.g., `your-fabric-endpoint`) with your actual credentials.

---

## Configuration
- **Microsoft Fabric**:  
  Configure your Fabric API endpoints and credentials in the `.env` file to enable data ingestion and processing.
- **Azure AI**:  
  Set up Azure AI services (e.g., Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI) and update the `.env` file with your API keys and endpoints.
- **Appwrite**:  
  Ensure your Appwrite instance is running and configured with the necessary credentials for authentication.

---

## Authentication (Appwrite)
AgroSense AI uses Appwrite for secure user authentication, including Google OAuth integration. Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Create an Appwrite Project**:
   - Log in to [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) and create a new project.
   - Note your `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` and generate an API key.

2. **Enable Google OAuth**:
   - In the Appwrite dashboard, go to **Authentication** > **Settings**.
   - Enable Google OAuth and input your Google API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).
   - Configure redirect URLs as per Appwrite’s documentation.

3. **Integrate Appwrite in the App**:
   - Use the `.env` variables to connect to Appwrite.
   - Initialize the Appwrite client in your project:
     ```javascript
     // appwriteConfig.js
     import { Client, Account } from 'appwrite';

     const client = new Client()
       .setEndpoint(process.env.APPWRITE_ENDPOINT)
       .setProject(process.env.APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID);

     export const account = new Account(client);
     ```

4. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Users can log in via Google OAuth or other methods configured in Appwrite.
   - Sessions are securely managed, and user logs are stored for analytics.

## Usage
1. **Launch the App**:
   Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator to run the app.

2. **Explore Features**:
   - **Home Screen**: View a summary of crop health, weather, and market trends.
   - **Crop Monitoring**: Access detailed sensor data and AI-driven insights.
   - **Weather Forecast**: Check upcoming weather predictions and crop impacts.
   - **Resource Optimization**: Get real-time resource usage recommendations.
   - **Market Trends**: Review market price and demand forecasts.

3. **User Authentication**:
   - Log in using Google OAuth or other configured methods.
   - Appwrite handles session management and user logging.

## Deployment
- **Build the App**:
  Generate production-ready builds with Expo:
  ```bash
  expo build:android
  expo build:ios
  ```
- **Publish the App**:
  Deploy to app stores or distribute internally. Ensure production `.env` settings are correctly configured.
